- This is a Twitter clone that I have both debugged, and added functionality to. Working on this project allowed me to get practice working with a relatively large codebase.
- I have added tests for all of the important functionality of the models and view functions.
- Note that this Twitter clone includes all of the main functionality of Twitter, including: registering, logging in/out, making a tweet (warble), liking a tweet, deleting your own tweet, viewing all of your liked tweets, following/unfollowing users, seeing who is following a user, seeing who a user is following, and deleting your own account.
- See my [commit history](https://github.com/jlh040/Twitter-Clone/commits/master) to find out exactly what I did to make this a fully functioning application.
